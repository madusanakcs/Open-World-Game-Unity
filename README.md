Welcome to SPAC Studios! This repository contains the game files for our latest project. Due to their size, we've uploaded them to our Document Management System (DMS).

## Accessing Game Files

To access the game files, please follow this link: [SPAC Studios DMS](https://dms.uom.lk/s/g9rao7BD59XYJ5x)

To access the game assets files, please follow this link: [Assets Files](https://uniofmora-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/kavindawmc_20_uom_lk/EvMTJcfgFXtNpNTYisxsRIkBzNbqptoF7d0oxM1vRNd_9w?e=9u8hHl)

For the best gaming experience, we recommend using the Windows build instead of WebGL. 
The WebGL version may sometimes deprecate certain assets, affecting the game's quality.

## Instructions to run the WebGL Game Build
1) Execute backend locally
2) Execute frontend locally
3) Download and extract the WebGL game file to a known directory
4) Open a powershell terminal where your index.html file is. You need to shift and right click to see Powershell appear as an option. The do the following command:

py -m http.server

This will host a Python server on your machine. This server will run your game when someone joins it. You can then try out your game by opening a web browser and typing "localhost:8000/". 

5) Watch this 1-minute video for a visual guide: [How to Run the WebGL Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ceqbmm7ydS8)

## Web Application

We use React to create the frontend, Spring Boot to create the backend, and MySQL as the database.

- **Frontend**: The frontend code can be found in [`Codes/WebAppliaction/Frontend/questionnaire`](./Codes/WebAppliaction/Frontend/questionnaire).

- **Backend**: The backend code can be found in [`Codes/WebAppliaction/Backend/questionnaire`](./Codes/WebAppliaction/Backend/questionnaire). 

- **Database Script**: The database script can be found in [`Codes/WebAppliaction/Backend/spacquestionnarie.sql`](./Codes/WebAppliaction/Backend/spacquestionnarie.sql).
  
Please refer to the individual README files in each directory for detailed instructions on setting up and running the frontend, backend, and database components of the application.
